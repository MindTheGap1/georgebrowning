                            <ul>
                                <li>For my university dissertation, I created an alternative to modern pitch tracking software (e.g. PitchF/X, Statcast) that utilises monocular vision and machine learning. The aim of this project was to create a cheap 
                                    alternative to current solutions that often require multi-camera setups, radar, and custom computational hardware. The project utilised entirely free software (such as Google Colab, Detectron2) and video recording that a modern smartphone is capable of.

                            <ul>
                                <li>My university placement year was spent at Red Bull Racing in Milton Keynes. For 13 months I was a placement student within the Aerodynamics Technology group, a sub-department of the Aerodynamics department.
                                    I developed and maintained software for the operation of the team's wind tunnel in Bedford, created technology solutions for members of the aerodynamics department, and deployed a handheld testing device to 
                                    the team's garage. I also assisted the race strategy department on race weekends in the operations room, monitoring driver radios, video feeds, and helping with the analysis of lap times. I delivered car parts
                                    to both the 2019 United States Grand Prix and the 2020 Australian Grand Prix.

                            <ul>
                                <li>I joined the Cardiff CUBS in 2017 when they were known as Cardiff Softball Club. I helped grow the club in its trial year as the first softball club in Wales.
                                    In 2018 I became the club president in its first official year as a university sports club, the 2018/19 season. I oversaw the transistion from Softball Club into Baseball and Softball Club. This transistion saw 
                                    the club grow considerably. New equipment had to be acquired, beginner players had to be trained, and club fixtures had to be organised. After my placement year from June 2019 to June 2020, I returned  
                                    as president once again and saw the club through a year frequently hampered by the COVID-19 pandemic.

                            <ul>
                                <li>I acted as technical lead for a 10-person development team within my university Group Project module. Our task was to build a movie rental website in a similar 
                                    style to that of Amazon or Netflix. The main function of the site was to provide movie recommendations for users based on a variety of factors such as their past viewing habits, 
                                    their ratings of similar movies, and the viewing habits of users with similar tastes. I frequently led the weekly group meetings and helped the group manage focus its development efforts.

                            <ul>
                                <li>I worked within a 5-person team to create a program that could present secondary school students a series of questions on a particular topic. The program contained admin tools 
                                    that could be used to add, remove, and modify questions, as well as tools to view student performance.The most important part about this project was that the program had to be 
                                    easy to use. I gained good experience in writing software with an end-user in mind. I also gained useful experience in design principles such as UML, and planning strategies such as the 
                                    gathering of functional and non-functional requirements.

                                <li>In 2017, I created an Android app intended to guide users around my home city while providing them useful information about interesting places they visited. The app was created 
                                    within Android Studio, and relied upon elements of the Google Maps API, such as creating and monitoring Geofences. I gained useful experience in development for Android devices, 
                                    specifically in areas such as handling user location data.

                            <ul>
                                <li>Student Robotics is an annual competition where students between the ages of 16 and 18 build fully autonomous robots to complete a set challenge. While in Sixth Form I was part 
                                    of my school's Student Robotics team, the robot that we created had to be able to find square boxes in an arena, and flip them so a specific colour was facing upwards. This was 
                                    a challenging competition, but gave me good experience with very open-ended problem solving. I enjoyed the opportunity to write meaningful software that could run on 
                                    a machine my teammates and I had built, instead of only having inside-the-classroom experience with PC-based software.

                            <ul>
                                <li>Featured in publications such as Wired, Business Insider, and the Guiness Book of World Records, MCMagic Parks was the largest online community of its kind. What 
                                    initially started as a hobby among a small group of people, building Walt Disney World on a 1:1 scale within Minecraft, became a large-scale project for over 30 people. 
                                    I worked on a large range of different tasks on MCMagic such as community management, ride systems engineering, and video production in order to provide a high quality, 
                                    family-friendly experience to over 400,000 unique users. MCMagic was the largest project I have been a part of, both in terms of team size, and project scale. I learnt to 
                                    adapt quickly to the large range of tasks I was required to do, as well as develop an acute attention to detail in order to create an accurate representation of the magic of 
                                    Disney that people could enjoy from their own homes. MCMagic was acquired in November 2016 by Palace Network LLC.
