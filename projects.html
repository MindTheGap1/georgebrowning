                        <ul>
                            <li>I joined the Cardiff CUBS in 2017 when they were known as Cardiff Softball Club. I helped grow the club in its trial year as the first softball club in Wales.
                                2018 is the club's first official year as a university sports club. I have taken over the role of President and have overseen the transition from Softball Club into Baseball and Softball Club. This transistion includes 
                                organisation of a large increase in both members and equipment. As a club, we are currently preparing to host our season opener in the British University Baseball League against the Swansea Seagulls 
                                in which I am acting as team captain. Later in the year we will be playing in more official fixtures, both home and away, including the Cardiff-Swansea Varsity Competition.

                        <ul>
                            <li>I am acting as current technical lead for a 10-person development team within my university Group Project module. Our task is to build a movie rental website in a similar 
                                style to that of Amazon or Netflix. The main function of the site is to provide movie recommendations for users based on a variety of factors such as their past viewing habits, 
                                their ratings of similar movies, and the viewing habits of users with similar tastes. We are utilising SCRUM for this project to capitalise on the iterative way in which this 
                                methodology allows us to work.

                            <li>Cardiff Racing is participating in its first year within the very new Driverless Formula Student Competition. I am working as a team member within the Action Formulation side 
                                of the team. My current roles include working on the car's control systems such as steering angle and brake pressure. I very much enjoy working on software that controls large, 
                                tangible pieces of hardware such as a race-car. Driverless Formula Student is also an exciting opportunity to gain experience within an emerging technology field (autonomous vehicles).

                                <li>Featured in publications such as Wired, Business Insider, and the Guiness Book of World Records, MCMagic Parks was the largest online community of its kind. What 
                                    initially started as a hobby among a small group of people, building Walt Disney World on a 1:1 scale within Minecraft, became a large-scale project for over 30 people. 
                                    I worked on a large range of different tasks on MCMagic such as community management, ride systems engineering, and video production in order to provide a high quality, 
                                    family-friendly experience to over 400,000 unique users. MCMagic was the largest project I have been a part of, both in terms of team size, and project scale. I learnt to 
                                    adapt quickly to the large range of tasks I was required to do, as well as develop an acute attention to detail in order to create an accurate representation of the magic of 
                                    Disney that people could enjoy from their own homes. MCMagic was acquired in November 2016 by Palace Network LLC.

                                <li>In 2017, I created an Android app intended to guide users around my home city while providing them useful information about interesting places they visited. The app was created 
                                    within Android Studio, and relied upon elements of the Google Maps API, such as creating and monitoring Geofences. I gained useful experience in development for Android devices, 
                                    specifically in areas such as handling user location data.

                                <li>Student Robotics is an annual competition where students between the ages of 16 and 18 build fully autonomous robots to complete a set challenge. While in Sixth Form I was part 
                                    of my school's Student Robotics team, the robot that we created had to be able to find square boxes in an arena, and flip them so a specific colour was facing upwards. This was 
                                    a challenging competition, but gave me good experience with very open-ended problem solving. I enjoyed the opportunity to write meaningful software that could run on 
                                    a machine my teammates and I had built, instead of only having inside-the-classroom experience with PC-based software.

                                <li>I worked within a 5-person team to create a program that could present secondary school students a series of questions on a particular topic. The program contained admin tools 
                                    that could be used to add, remove, and modify questions, as well as tools to view student performance.The most important part about this project was that the program had to be 
                                    easy to use. I gained good experience in writing software with an end-user in mind. I also gained useful experience in design principles such as UML, and planning strategies such as the 
                                    gathering of functional and non-functional requirements.
